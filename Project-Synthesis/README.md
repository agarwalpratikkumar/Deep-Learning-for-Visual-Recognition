<br>
In GAN we have a Discriminator Model and a Generator Model. The task of Generative model is to generate fake images which looks like real. And the task of Discriminative model is to identify whether the image is coming from the actual data source or its a fake image generated by Generator. <br>



__Generated Images:__
After trainig our model on LSUN conference dataset we got following result: <br>

__After 1 epoch:__ ![fake_samples_epoch_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41232373/52541405-e8767d80-2d94-11e9-972a-d00ba9a8e60d.png)

<br>

__After 37 epochs:__ ![fake_samples_epoch_38](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41232373/52541414-07750f80-2d95-11e9-948f-5d8c3dfb2ce0.png)

<br>
We can easily see that most of the generated images are actually looking like real images.
